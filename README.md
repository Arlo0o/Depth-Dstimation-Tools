# Monocular and Stereo Depth Estimation Tools

This is a complete depth prediction project with front-end QT pages and back-end algorithms to test monocular depth prediction, SGM-based and deep learning-based binocular stereo matching algorithms.

## üïπÔ∏è Getting Started

**Install the packages with Python 3.8 by: 

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need to download the [pre-trained weights](https://github.com/intel-isl/DPT/releases/download/1_0/dpt_hybrid-midas-501f0c75.pt) for dpt and put them in ```dpt\weights``` folder to start the monocular depth prediction algorithm.

You need to have access to a binocular camera in your local computer to use the stereo matching algorithm. 


**Hardware and Functions:

You can use the functions in the left part to choose local files and predition the depth maps with grey-scale or color-scale.

You can use the functions in the right part to enable real-time depth prediction with monocular or stereo cameras, our experiments are evaluated NVIDIA RTX 2060.
